# Prerequisites

- Dolphin: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
- Archipelago: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases
- Subspace Emissary APWorld: https://github.com/kenniky/ArchipelagoSSE/releases
- Super Smash Bros. Brawl USA ROM
  - Development was done on a rev 2 ROM, but in the APWorld's current state I think the revision doesn't matter

# Installing the APWorld

Put the `ssbb_sse.apworld` file in the `custom_worlds` folder of your Archipelago installation. You can also just double-click the file to automatically install it.

# Configuring the YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

Once you've installed the apworld, you can generate a yaml using the `Generate Template Options` button in the ArchipelagoLauncher. It can be found in `Players/Templates` after you have done so. The name of the file will be `Super Smash Bros. Brawl - The Subspace Emissary.yaml`.

If the .yaml file is missing in your `Players/Templates` folder, then please go through the apworld installation steps again, and double check that everything was done correctly.

# Generating a game

You can follow the [official instructions](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game) to generate a game.

# Playing

Once the server is up, find the `Subspace Emissary Client` option in your Archipelago Launcher. Clicking on this will bring up a text client that will prompt you for the necessary server connection info. Once you're in, just boot up Dolphin with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, select The Subspace Emissary, and you're good to go!

*Note: The Subspace Emissary APWorld does not currently require a patched ROM.*
